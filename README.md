Banking Management System | TYBCA Project

The Banking Management System is a complex software solution developed to help 
banks and financial institutions manage and optimise their operations. With ever-increasing client demands and the complexity of banking processes, an efficient 
and integrated system is critical for the seamless operation of banking operations.
The following section provides a quick overview of the Banking Management 
System.  

Flaws of the existing banking system:
  ▪ Less security of customer and bank information.  
  ▪ Demands additional manpower and physical labour.  
  ▪ It will take much longer time and extra resources to do all the manual 
entering and editing.  
  ▪ There is no disaster protection for paper documents.  
  ▪ There is no information backup.  
Optimization of the proposed banking management system:  
  ▪ Increased security by integrating a layer of authentication and authorization.  
  ▪ Requires minimal manpower.  
  ▪ Ease the data entry and editing concerns.  
  ▪ Minimal focus on resources necessary for the maintenance of data.  
  ▪ Comparatively reliable, adaptable and efficient.  
  ▪ There will be an automatic backup mechanism in place for the client and bank information, ensuring that the data is protected from many types of disasters.
